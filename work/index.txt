## Overview

This project focuses on land type classification using a hybrid approach combining deep learning and machine learning. We utilized the **UC Merced dataset** and **NASA satellite images**, leveraging **InceptionV3** for feature extraction and **Weka** for classification. The goal was to improve land-use monitoring through an accurate and scalable detection system.

## Key Features

- **Deep Learning Feature Extraction**: Used **InceptionV3** to extract deep features from satellite images, capturing high-level spatial patterns.
- **Texture Feature Analysis**: Extracted **GLCM-based texture features** (contrast, homogeneity, correlation) to enhance classification accuracy.
- **Machine Learning Classification**: Trained **LMT, RF, and RT** classifiers in **Weka**, achieving up to **98% accuracy** using **10-fold cross-validation**.
- **Web-Based Deployment**: Developed an interactive web interface allowing users to upload satellite images and receive land-type predictions.

## Technologies Used

- **InceptionV3**: Deep learning-based feature extractor for satellite imagery.
- **Weka**: Machine learning toolkit for classification and analysis.
- **GLCM (Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix)**: Texture feature extraction for improved classification accuracy.
- **Python & OpenCV**: For preprocessing and feature extraction.(Tensorflow)
- **Flask & React**: To build a web-based interface for real-time classification.

## Challenges and Learnings

- **High Dimensionality**: Managing large feature vectors from deep learning and texture extraction required dimensionality reduction techniques.
- **Data Generalization**: Ensuring the model performs well on different datasets, including **NASA Landsat images**.
- **Web Deployment**: Optimizing model inference time for a smooth user experience in a web environment.

## Outcome

This project successfully combined deep learning and machine learning to classify land types with **98% accuracy**. The web interface enables seamless interaction, allowing users to analyze satellite images effortlessly. Future improvements include **real-time data integration and cloud-based processing** to expand scalability.

## Overview

This project involved redesigning and developing the official website for **Safety Saarthi**, a fire system installation company. The goal was to enhance user experience, improve performance, and ensure seamless deployment using cloud technologies. 

I started by **redesigning the website in Figma**, focusing on a modern, intuitive UI/UX. Then, I built the frontend using **Angular** for a dynamic and responsive experience. The website was deployed using **AWS services** for optimal performance and scalability.

## Key Features

- **Modern UI/UX Redesign**: Created a professional and user-friendly design in Figma.
- **Built with Angular**: Developed a fast, scalable frontend using Angular’s component-based architecture.
- **AWS-Powered Hosting**: Utilized AWS services for secure and efficient deployment:
  - **S3** for static hosting  
  - **CloudFront** for content delivery  
  - **Route 53** for domain management  
  - **AWS Lambda** for email functions  

## Technologies Used

- **Figma** – UI/UX design & prototyping  
- **Angular** – Frontend framework for dynamic user interfaces  
- **AWS S3, CloudFront, Route 53, Lambda** – Scalable cloud hosting  
- **TypeScript & SCSS** – Clean, maintainable code structure  

## Challenges & Learnings

One of the main challenges was optimizing performance for a fast-loading experience. Using **CloudFront for caching** and **lazy loading Angular modules** helped achieve smooth performance. Additionally, integrating AWS services efficiently required setting up proper IAM roles and policies for security.

## Outcome

The redesigned Safety Saarthi website is now **live at [www.safetysaarthi.com](https://www.safetysaarthi.com)**, offering a professional, high-performance platform for customers to learn about fire safety solutions. The new design and AWS-powered infrastructure have improved both **usability** and **reliability**, helping the company establish a stronger digital presence.

## Overview

**WealthWise** is a stock investment and portfolio tracking platform that enables users to manage their financial assets efficiently. It provides real-time stock market data, investment tracking, and seamless transactions through a secure banking integration.

I built this platform using the **MERN stack**, leveraging **Alpha Vantage API** for real-time stock data and implementing **secure banking transactions** with dummy accounts. The platform ensures seamless user experience with a **Material UI frontend** and **optimized backend API**.

## Key Features

- **Stock Market Dashboard**: Displays real-time stock prices from NSE & BSE.
- **Investment Portfolio Management**: Users can track stocks they own and view profit/loss calculations.
- **Stock Trading (Buy/Sell)**: Users can invest in stocks using funds from their **dummy bank accounts**.
- **Secure Transactions**: Implements authentication & banking transactions securely.
- **Historical Data & Insights**: Users can view stock performance over time.
- **Material UI & Responsive Design**: Built with a modern UI for seamless navigation.

## Technologies Used

- **Tech Stack (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js)** – Full-stack implementation  
- **Sequelize ORM** – PostgreSQL database integration  
- **Alpha Vantage API** – Real-time stock data  
- **Material UI** – Clean and professional UI components  
- **JWT Authentication & OAuth** – Secure user authentication  
- **AWS (S3, EC2, RDS)** – Cloud hosting & database management  

## Challenges & Learnings

Building a **real-time stock tracking system** required handling frequent API calls efficiently. Implementing **caching mechanisms** and optimizing database queries helped ensure smooth performance. Additionally, handling **secure banking transactions** involved designing robust validation mechanisms.

## Outcome

WealthWise is now a **fully functional investment platform**, offering users a seamless way to manage stocks and portfolios. With real-time stock data and secure banking integration, it helps investors **make informed decisions** effortlessly.
